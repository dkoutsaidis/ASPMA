## "Audio Signal Processing for Music Applications"
In this repository I include all of my python codes for the [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/audio-signal-processing) assignments.


## How to use
In order to compile and use these codes you have to download ["sms-tools"](https://github.com/MTG/sms-tools) from the "Music Technology Group - Universitat Pompeu Fabra" github and follow their instuctions described in the corresponding ["README.md"](https://github.com/MTG/sms-tools/blob/master/README.md) file.


## Disclaimer
My purposes in this repository are to share my work with other programmers and attendants of the course in order to get feedback about improving and upgrading my codes as well as discussing my implementations. I have no intention to provide cheat answers for the course assignments and Î™ do not urge anyone to do it.
